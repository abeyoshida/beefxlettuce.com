      desc: 'In 2007 Bear Stearns introduced a new structured equity product to a European and Asian market.  A large  part of the strategy was to build a strategic online platform that would allow clients to transact certificates, retail notes, medium-term notes, and CDs from indicative valuations posted live on the website.  Through the site new structured products were being marketed.  Additional site functionality included localization for specific markets,  the ability to make requests for quotes on items in the secondary market along with the option for clients to structure new securities that they would be interested in buying. My responsibilities included requirement gathering from the London equity desk, creation of a branded site design in Fireworks, CSS,  Javascript using Mootools, client side architecture to accomodate Ajax calls to structured data sources as well as localized html chunks and images for each regional area. When JPMorgan took control of Bear Stearns this business was shut down and the website is no longer available.'

There was a blotter-like grid display that opened to product details along with charting that were based on prices from various time frames.  The request for quote app was being tested in a development environment when Bear Stearns crashed. The indicative pricing pages relied heavily on Ajax for data consumption and display as well as parsing data into valid xml for Fusion Charts\' Flash templates.
